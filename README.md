Tanzanian Water wells Status Prediction
In many regions, water pumps suffer from frequent malfunctions, leading to severe consequences on water access and public health. Our goal is to:
Diagnose: Accurately determine the operational status of water pumps. Classify: Identify whether a pump is fully operational, partially functional, or non functional. Inform: Provide actionable insights to stakeholders for prioritizing maintenance, thereby reducing downtime. This isnâ€™t merely a machine learning challenge; it's about transforming data into insights that can save lives and improve living conditions.
This problem naturally fits into a multi-class classification framework. The three primary classes are:

Functional (Fully Operational)

Functional Needs Repair (Partially Functional)

Non Functional (Faulty)
Challenges:
Class Imbalance: Often, the number of pumps in one category (say, fully operational) may dominate the dataset, while malfunctioning pumps might be fewer. Data Quality and Feature Selection: Sensors might provide noisy data, and maintenance logs can be incomplete. Changing Conditions: Pumps might deteriorate suddenly due to environmental factors, suggesting that a static model might be insufficient. Considering a periodic model update or even a time series approach might be beneficial.
